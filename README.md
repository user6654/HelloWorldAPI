    Homework Assignment #1

    This is the first of several homework assignments you'll receive in this course. In order to receive your 
    certificate of completion (at the end of this course) you must complete all the assignments and receive a
    passing grade. 

    How to Turn It In:

    1. Create a public github repo for this assignment. 

    2. Create a new thread in the discussion forum and note "Homework Assignment #1" at the top of your post.

    3. In that thread, discuss what you have built, and include the link to your Github repo. 

    The Assignment:

    Please create a simple "Hello World" API. Meaning:

    1. It should be a RESTful JSON API that listens on a port of your choice. 

    2. When someone posts anything to the route /hello, you should return a welcome message, in JSON format. This
    message can be anything you want.
